# 21_Deep_Learning_Challenge# Alphabet Soup Neural Network Project  

## Overview  
This repository contains code and models for the **Alphabet Soup** deep learning project. The goal of this project is to develop a neural network model that predicts the success of funding applications.  

## Repository Structure  
- **Challenge 21 writeup.pdf** – Project report summarizing analysis and results.  
- **Code/** – Jupyter notebooks for model training and optimization:  
  - `model_training.ipynb` – Initial model training script.  
  - `model_optimization.ipynb` – Optimized model with hyperparameter tuning.  
- **Models/** – Saved neural network models:  
  - `my_model.keras` – Initial trained model.  
  - `my_model3.keras` – Optimized version of the model.  
- **LICENSE** – Project license information.  
- **README.md** – This file.  

## Usage  
1. Open `model_training.ipynb` to train the initial deep learning model.  
2. Run `model_optimization.ipynb` to improve model performance.  
3. Evaluate saved models (`.keras` files) using TensorFlow/Keras.  

## Dependencies  
- Python 3.x  
- TensorFlow/Keras  
- Pandas  
- Scikit-learn  
- Jupyter Notebook
